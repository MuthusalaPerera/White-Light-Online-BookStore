<p style="text-align: justify; font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', 'Myriad Pro', 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', Helvetica, Arial, 'sans-serif'">It is noted in our society, that even educated people do not like reading books. They try to spend their leisure time with their friends or 
hanging around without any reason, thus wasting it in unhealthy and frivolous activities.
A person can always avoid such company by indulging in other activities such as keeping company with those who have a positive approach to life 
as well as a constructive and creative mind.
 However, spending time with books is much better than all these activities. A book never speaks without one’s permission; 
 it does not bother and is always at one’s disposal.
A person who intends to read should try to pick good books because life is busy and time is scarce.
 We cannot afford to spend time reading all sorts of books. A thinker says. “Life is short…too short to everything. Choose, you must. 
 Choose only the best friends and in books!” 
Books are real treasures and everyone should look for these. When a person opens books, he finds treasures of goodness and wisdom which
 spring out from its pages along with good pieces of advice, sound teaching, counsels and truths.
Good books are the light house that enlightens our minds, families, schools and societies. They educate hearts, improve characters, console and delight us.
Reading books is a source to beat boredom and defeat loneliness. It is also a source to resume day with new vigour and enthusiasm. 
For the sound body, a nourished mind is important and for a nourished mind, book reading it important.
People from all walks of life should read because it has great importance, especially for people like politicians, instructors and teachers. 
If they develop the habit of reading, they can prove themselves as the master of their fields and secure the best place in practical life!</P><br>
